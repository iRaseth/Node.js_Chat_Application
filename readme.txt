To run the app correctly : 

1. Set up ur db, for the project purposes it would be mysql 

2. After having it done, run the index.js 

// Configuring the app is about getting the 3 paths at the url after 
// running the script, 
	
	- /createDatabase !!! AFTER DOING SO, UNCOMMENT THE database
			  !!! index.js line : 20
	- /createusertable

	- /createposttable

3. Register the new user, login into the app afterwards !
